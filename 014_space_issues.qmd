## Equivalence and Independence

(Based on discussions in Jayet, p. 2-13)

Statistical analysis is based on two key principles, or invariants:

1.  **All observations must be statistically equivalent**: This means that no individual observation should be systematically different from others in the sample set. Each data point must have the same probability distribution, ensuring uniformity and comparability.

2.  **All observations must be independent from each other**: In any statistical model, the assumption is that the occurrence of one observation does not influence or depend on another. Independence ensures the integrity of statistical results.

However, both of these principles are challenged when applied in a **spatial context**. Spatial data often exhibit **dependencies due to geographic proximity, which violates the assumption of independence**. Similarly, the notion of **statistical equivalence becomes problematic as spatial heterogeneity introduces variability across observations in different locations and because the spatial definition of objects may vary and their sampling irregular.**

These challenges highlight the **need for specialized approaches in spatial analysis**, where standard statistical methods must be adapted to account for the structure and dependencies present in the spatial data.

## Equivalence

### Irregularity of observations and the nature of data

While there are time cycles, making repetitive data logging along the time dimension doable, there is no such think as a spatial cycle for geographical data recording.

Most spatial data has a irregular covering in space, which already challenges the **equivalence of observations**

Observations (countries) are of different size, i.e. the surface attribute $m$ matters here.

Suppose $Z_{pop}$ is the country population. One can expect $Z_{pop}$ to relate to $m$ if processes are homogeneous across space. However a $Z/m$ density variables would still show these objects are very different.

Yet, other $Z_i$ variables could still be compared using that $Z_{pop}$ attributes. For example the active population of the place (country) as a percentage of its total population, or using other transformations (linear or not).

Note that variations in volume/mass/size such as $Z_{pop}$ are very common, with very few objects having a very large size compared to most others. Such a size effect

-   impacts on the total and central (mean, median) value of variables
-   the distribution of values when made in different observations' regions
-   typically leads to outliers problems or heteroskedasticity (non constant variance)

However, there are raster maps and some information is "regular", such a precipitation, or can be "regularized", such as population grids.

The discretization of geographic space should however be internally homogeneous, meaning the attributes within each grid cell (or other nwe objects) supposed to apply to every part of that cell.

A difference is often made between continuous field data and discrete space objects.

### Modifiable Areal unit Problem - MAUP

@openshaw1984

-   Areal units = spatial objects such as zones or places or towns or regions

> Geography has consistently and dismally failed to tackle its entitation problems, and in that more than anything else lies the root of so many of its problems (Chapman 77)

> **Insufficient thought is given to precisely what it is that is being studied.** \[...\] Little concern has been expressed about the nature and definition of the spatial objects under study

> For many purposes the zones in a zoning system constitute the objects, or geographical individuals, that are the basic units for the observation and measurement of spatial phenomena.

> With areal data, the **spatial objects only exist after data collected for one set of entities (e.g. people) are subjected to an arbitrary aggregation** (see also regularity discussion above) to produce a set of spatial units.

> However, there are no rules for areal aggregation, no standards, and no international conventions to guide the spatial aggregation process.

> **The areal units (zonal objects) used in many geographical studies are arbitrary, modifiable.** Census areas have rarely an intrinsic geographical meaning

> A unmanageable combinatorial problem: There are approximately 10\^12 different aggregations of 1,000 objects into 20 groups. If the aggregation process is constrained so that the groups consist of **internally contiguous objects** (i.e. all the objects assigned to the same group are geographical neighbours) then this huge number is reduced, but only by a few orders of magnitude.

Stan Openshaw distingues 2 interrelated issues, within the MAUP:

-   The **scale problem**: the variation in results that can often be obtained when data for one set of areal units are progressively aggregated into fewer and larger units for analysis.
-   The **aggregation problem**: the problem of alternative combinations of areal units at equal or similar scales. Any variation in results due to the use of alternative units of analysis when the number of units is held constant

Example of effects on correlation coefficients:

-   Correlation between percentage vote for Republican candidates in the congressional election of 1968 and the percentage of the population over 60 years
-   Correlation at the 99 county level is 0.34
-   After aggregation into six zones: 0.26 for the 6 congressional districts and 0.86 for a simple typology of Iowa into 6 rural-urban types (Openshaw and Taylor 77)
-   Compare mean and dispersion of correlation coefficient after random zoning (using contiguity) and random sampling (grouping)

![](images/clipboard-105223237.png){width="643"}

-   No systematic scale effect on correlation mean
-   Considerable variability about the mean values but reduces with increasing numbers of units
-   The standard deviations of the zoning distributions are considerably smaller than the corresponding sampling distributions but exhibit a greater degree of bias \> **spatial autocorrelation effect**

## Spatial (in-)dependence

### Interactions between observations

-   **Not only the dimensions and structures of observations is of importance but also their relative position in space**

-   **The distance (between objects),** $d(L)$, is at the very heart of geographical analysis AND the source of statistical difficulties

-   The level of interactions increases with proximity (distance functions or contiguities) (see gravity-based theories)
