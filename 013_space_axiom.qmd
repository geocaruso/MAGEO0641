# Geographical space {#sec-geographical-space}

The adjectives spatial and geographical are used interchangeably within this course. We can still attach the adjective **geographical** to the term **space** as we want to emphasize some properties or difficulties of working with geographical data.

One way to see those properties is to consider the axiomatic of the Geographical Space introduced by @beguin_axiomatic_1979, whose purpose was to (p326)

> Express axiomatically a geographical space by measures defined on a metric

## Absolute or pre-geographical space:

-   A set of places or locations $S$
-   Identified by their coordinates $x,y$
-   Separated by a distance $d(L)$
-   Distance being measured along a given metric $L$

## Geographical space:

S can be endowed with various attributes to form a **geographical space**:

- The surface attribute $m$, measured along a given metric related to coordinates

- Various attributes $Z$

- Density measures, i.e. any $Z/m$
