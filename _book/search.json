It has been produced as a Quarto book by Geoffrey Caruso and Léandre Fabri with the aim of aggregating and homogenizing different material accumulated over the past few years.\nAs of September 2024, the assemblage is still a work in progress. We kindly ask you to refer to your notes during class to prepare for the examination and assignments.\nThe general structure and base material shown here have been organized by Geoffrey Caruso, who originally inherited teaching material from Dominique Peeters. We are grateful to the previous teaching assistants, Mirjam Schindler and Marlène Boura, as well as to David Dabin and Jonathan Jones, for their contributions.",

    "text": "1.1 Scope\nThis course is an introduction to standard statistical techniques that geographers often encounter. Being at the crossroads of different fields, it is necessary for geographers to have a basic set of tools with which to interact with other experts and modelers who, although they may use different wording and have their own technical habits, use a common set of concepts and tools to analyze data and test their hypotheses.\nIn their own work and in their interactions with others, it is also important for geographers to keep in mind that the data they use are quite specific because they are about located objects or subjects, about places and their interactions. Most of the time, the data they use is georeferenced in some way (accurately or not). This inherently geographic aspect brings with it a number of challenges. In this course, we will highlight these challenges when performing standard data analysis. However, we won’t solve any of these geographic problems, and we won’t even explicitly use geographic features, i.e., no mapping, no use of georeferencing as such. Our goal is to equip students with standard statistical methods also used in related fields, with some critical thinking about their geographical nature or underlying spatial processes. In a nutshell, this is a journey from elementary statistics to spatial autocorrelation with a standard regression detour.",

    "text": "1.2 Transparent geographical analysis empowered with R\nThe course is a blend of theory and practice, which we believe enhances intuition and understanding. Direct practice also helps - especially for human geographers with little training in quantitative methods - to demystify statistical concepts and provide confidence after repeated applications and interpretations.\nSoftware for statistical analysis has evolved rapidly and R is prominent in many disciplines. It is open and free. It is simply fantastic for spatial data analysis and may well be the only tool geographers really need in their data undertaking, even replacing GIS (Geographic Information Systems) software. You just need to get started with R.\nMost of our students have had some sort of theoretical statistics course so far in their studies, so they have probably seen most of the content. Sometimes our students have had some practice with SPSS (or similar) software, but most have not used any real statistical software at all, and have a spreadsheet (e.g., Excel) as their only reference for data management, analysis, and graphing. We chose R for its openness, leadership, large community, and later for its spatial features, but also because it forces students to be transparent and think about every step they take. Data analysis and visualization can be misleading and dangerous, it is necessary to think and facilitate replication for oneself and for others. R, and more generally the use of scripts and command lines, is absolutely necessary to bring robustness and trust.",

    "text": "2.1 Interdisciplinarity and perspective\nData analysis and statistics are used in many scientific fields. When the focus is on geographic objects, subjects, their patterns or relationships, we like to talk about spatial analysis. However, because geographic data is relevant to many fields and statistical methods are widely used, spatial analysis can be defined and approached differently.\nWithin geography, we understand the term spatial analysis to refer to all quantitative approaches, as opposed to qualitative approaches (although these can also be spatial and analytical). Within the quantitative part of the discipline, however, spatial analysis would mostly refer to applied statistical approaches, in contrast to GIS modeling, geosimulation, transportation modeling, or mathematical models. In this sense, this course is a spatial analysis course.\nHowever, for those researchers involved in spatial analysis close to regional science and economic geography (and perhaps close to landscape ecology and GIScience), the terms spatial data analysis or spatial statistics would more strictly refer to the explicit use of geographic information in the modeling process, not just the consideration of geographic elements. See for example the (10.1007/978-3-642-03647-7?) handbook for discussion and examples.",

    "text": "2.3 Equivalence and Independence\nStatistical analysis is based on two key principles, or invariants:\n\nAll observations must be statistically equivalent: This means that no individual observation should be systematically different from others in the sample set. Each data point must have the same probability distribution, ensuring uniformity and comparability.\nAll observations must be independent from each other: In any statistical model, the assumption is that the occurrence of one observation does not influence or depend on another. Independence ensures the integrity of statistical results.\n\nHowever, both of these principles are challenged when applied in a spatial context. Spatial data often exhibit dependencies due to geographic proximity, which violates the assumption of independence. Similarly, the notion of statistical equivalence becomes problematic as spatial heterogeneity introduces variability across observations in different locations.\nThese challenges highlight the need for specialized approaches in spatial analysis, where standard statistical methods must be adapted to account for the structure and dependencies present in the spatial data.\n(Based on discussions in Jayet, p. 2-13)",

    "text": "2.2 Links with theory\nScience progresses with tools and techniques but also by testing hypotheses and updating models and theory. How spatial analysis is linked to theory also depends on fields or subfields.\nFrom a quantitative geography viewpoint (adapted from Denise Pumain https://hypergeo.eu/theories-of-spatial-analysis/?lang=en), spatial analysis focuses on uncovering spatial structures and organizations. These structures can often be generalized into models, such as center-periphery relationships, gravity models, and urban hierarchies and networks.\nThe ultimate goal of spatial analysis is then to understand the processes that lead to the formation of these spatial structures.\nFrom a spatial economic or regional science viewpoint (as understood by a European quantitative geographer) spatial analysis consists of a set of techniques designed to:\n\nDescribe the location of activities and how they change over time\nEstimate reduced form models\n\nUnlike structural form models, which are direct representations or formulations of theoretical concepts, reduced form models are designed to better align with and fit the data.\nThere is probably no such a reduced or structural form model in quantitative geography, but in both case anyway, spatial analysis ultimately aims at testing and updating theories.\nWe very much agree with this perspective here, leading to giving more importance to the falsification of ideas and the interpretation of estimated coefficients much more than to prediction using as many data as possible. If a variable is used it is because we have some idea of its importance and influence on others, not just to obtain a fit. Hence we won’t use automatic models constructions (no automated regression variable selection), and leave aside all the methods (neural networks, random forests, etc.) from which coefficients (if any) are difficult to interpret, even if they can be considered to belong to spatial analysis and use data. This course is not about data mining or data crunching. We use a statistical lens to examine variations across space and how spatial relationships influence socio-economic patterns and behaviors or environmental effects.",
